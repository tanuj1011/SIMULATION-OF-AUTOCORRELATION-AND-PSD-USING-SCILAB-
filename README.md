# SIMULATION-OF-AUTOCORRELATION-AND-PSD-USING-SCILAB-
## AIM
Write a program for Autocorrelation and PSD of signals in SCILAB and verify Wiener-Khinchin relation.

## EQUIPMENTS NEEDED

•	Computer with i3 Processor
•	SCI LAB

## THEORY
The Wiener-Khinchin theorem states that the power spectral density of a wide sense stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function.

## ALGORITHM
1.	Load or Define the Signal: Input your time-domain signal.
2.	Compute Autocorrelation: Calculate the autocorrelation function of the signal.
3.	Compute Power Spectral Density (PSD): Estimate the PSD of the signal, either directly using a method like Welch’s periodogram or by using the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation.
4.	Plot Results: Visualize the autocorrelation function and PSD.

## PROCEDURE

•	Refer Algorithms and write code for the experiment.

•	Open SCILAB in System

•	Type your code in New Editor

•	Save the file

•	Execute the code

•	If any Error, correct it in code and execute again

•	Verify the generated waveform using Tabulation and Model Waveform

## PROGRAM
cla
clear.all;
t=0:0.01:2*3.14;
x=sin(2*t);
subplot(3,2,1);
plot (x);
au=xcorr (x, x) ;
subplot (3,2,2);
plot (au);
v=fft(au);
subplot(3,2,3);
plot (abs (v));
fw=fft(x);
gubplot (3,2,4);
plot (fw);
fw2=(abs (fw)).^2;
gubplot (3,2,5);
plot (fw2);

## RESULT`
Thus the Autocorrelation and PSD are executed in Scilab and output is verified.
